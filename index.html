								Our story so far…
							</h3>
							<p>
								The story begins with our founders and their experience of establishing Liger Leadership Academy in Cambodia. Now  -  as the reputation and impact of LIger Leadership Academy in Cambodia continues to grow -     we begin a new chapter, by establishing a   sister school - LIger Leadership Academy in New Zealand. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Our founders Trevor and Agnieszka Gile first visited Cambodia in 2002 and fell in love with the country and its people. 
							</p>
							<p>
								Coming from humble beginnings in the    Seattle area,  Trevor recognised that the opportunities he had did not exist for those in the developing world. He believed that the big equalizer would be to provide opportunities for those who could take advantage of them. For Agnieszka, Cambodia reminded her of her home country  of Poland with so many years    of oppression  and World War II genocide.      She was determined to give the children of Cambodia this new opportunity.

						<div class="story-section__content-text-wrap">
							<p>
								Encouraged by the idea that the most effective form of aid is a hand up rather than a hand out, The Liger Charitable Foundation was formed with Liger Leadership Academy as its pilot project. In 2009, Trevor and Agnieszka began extensive research and planning to develop the concept.
							</p>
							<p>
								Attracting a top-notch team of specialists from all areas of education and non-profit development, they created a new type of organisation providing resources and guidance for promising children as a long-term investment to help the entire Cambodian society. The first academy was opened in 2012 and now hosts 103 learners.
							</p>
							<p>
								Today, Liger Leadership Academy Cambodia is more than a school. In addition to the essential curriculum, we educate learners in project, opportunity and experiential-based learning. Our innovative model has enabled our young leaders to excel beyond traditional subjects. The learners on the Cambodia campus have become internationally published authors, app and digital currency developers, regionally recognized robotics engineers, and national award-winning filmmakers – all by the age of 18.

							Leadership Skills 
						</h3>
						<p>
							Our leadership competencies provide a major focus of the curriculum and a core part of our mission to develop socially conscious, entrepreneurial leaders of tomorrow. The focus on these recognise that the skills needed by today’s young adults are not only subject area content commonly taught today, but non-academic skills critically needed for success in their future. 
						</p>
						<p>
							Inspired by our own research and a study done by the Harvard Business School, we have developed a list of 12 leadership characteristics. Students are evaluated on these skills throughout the year. These leadership competencies are:

							Our Beliefs 
						</h3>
						<p>
							We believe that students engage best when learning is authentic, student-directed, personalised, and essential. So when our learners are immersed in learning - whether it is an exploration, essential, expertise or extension programme - they will experience learning that is built from   these beliefs. 
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="two-color-items">
						<div class="two-color-item white-item">
							<h3>
								Authentic
							</h3>
							<p>
								Students learn subject content, skills and values through doing. Authentic learning is used extensively to integrate student learning experiences into the real world. To fully implement authentic learning we work in partnership with a wide variety of individuals and organisations in the community. 

							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="two-color-item blue-item">
							<h3>
								Student-directed 
							</h3>
							<p>
								Self directed learning is when learners have input and involvement in the learning process. Our students gain a more in-depth, longer-lasting understanding of subject area content and skills when given the opportunity to work together with other learners and learning facilitators to create meaningful projects. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="two-color-item blue-item">
							<h3>
								Personalised
							</h3>
							<p>
								Personalised learning is tailoring learning experiences to each student that is essential to their desired future. It is a unique experience for everyone and extends well beyond the classroom. Individual student plans are created for each student every year based upon their academic potential and interests. 
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="two-color-item white-item">
							<h3>
								Essential
							</h3>
							<p>
								Essential learning is the development of foundational knowledge and understanding in critical aspects of learning that give learners the academic base they need for future learning opportunities both at the academy and beyond. Essential courses are taught using more traditional teaching methods. Our learners develop a deep understanding of Math, English, and Science. Other subjects are developed through project and experiential-based learning experiences.

							<h3>
								Explorations 
							</h3>
							<p>
								Explorations at Liger Leadership Academy are project-based experiences where students work together in groups of 12 to explore a relevant, often complex question, problem or challenge. This project-based-learning is almost always enhanced with intensive activities that involve student immersion in real world experiences outside of the classroom.
							</p>
							<p>
								By engaging real issues in the outside world, students focus on big picture systems thinking and create a final product or action that causes change or serves a meaningful purpose. This process helps each student develop individually and communally as creators and innovators. It ensures deep and authentic learning – engaging students in critical thinking, problem solving and decision making in contexts that are relevant to them.
							</p>
							<p>
								During an exploration, our learning facilitator provides general direction for an individual or group of students to achieve a set of goals without a rigid step-by-step approach to solving the issue. This system allows each student’s leadership qualities to emerge. Students take advantage of meaningful opportunities that arise during the exploration and focus on higher levels of inquiry and the big picture as much as possible.
							</p>
							<p>
								Through our project-based-learning model, Liger aims to create a group of entrepreneurial thinkers. In a quickly changing world, the ability to see, create and develop new opportunities will be vital for the future.  
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="simple-text-section__text-wrap">
							<h3>Essentials</h3>
							<p>
								Every learner takes five essential subjects every term – English literacy, math, science and technology. While the general subjects stay the same, the area of study within these subjects varies and the difficulty level of these subjects increases with each year.
							</p>
							<p>
								While we are not a STEM school, we believe in placing a strong emphasis on STEM in our curriculum. At this moment, there is a strong need for graduates with STEM skills in New Zealand and, in the future, we believe that leadership needs will be increasingly dependent on STEM skills.
							</p>
							<p>
								Liger Leadership Academy is an English   medium school. As well as developing all  around literate students, we place a strong emphasis on reading, writing, listening and speaking English; this gives all our students the best opportunity for university admittance and future job possibilities.

						<h3 class="section-header">Impact Investment </h3>
						<p>
							We focus on impact. Our learners listen to the needs of individuals and organisations around them and regularly design and implement projects around meaningful opportunities that arise in the community that are truly needed. Their projects make a difference.
						</p>
						<p>
							We empower learners to develop leadership skills by making a difference for others. Learning experiences are designed around the concept of reaching out beyond the learners themselves to create a positive impact on the surrounding people, environments, and communities.
						</p>
						<p> 
							Focusing on impact is based on the premise that strong results occur when learners learn about and practice being leaders who create positive change, but additionally, learning quality itself such as engagement and long term memory is enhanced by learning experiences that are real, positive and meaningful.
						</p>
						<p>
							Our students learn not to underestimate the impact that they can have on someone else’s life.
						</p>
						<p>
							A vital aspect of the education programme is to empower learners to develop leadership skills by making a difference for others. Learning experiences are designed around the concept of reaching out beyond the learners themselves to create a positive impact on the surrounding people, environments, policies, etc. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This is essential not only to the people they impact, but also to help learners practice gaining the skills and values needed to be future leaders.  Our key impact is creating the next generation of leaders and changemakers in New Zealand. 
						</p>
						<p>
							This is proven through the impact our learners have on others during their time.
